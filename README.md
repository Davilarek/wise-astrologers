# Heroes of Might and Magic III style weekly messages generator

This is a social experiment that generates weekly, pseudo-randomly generated
messages, global and same for every visitor.

The idea behind this project was to create something similar to
[Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_III)
weekly messages, but with different contents, more humorous.

Every week, the message will be updated automatically by script running on
server side.

## Planned features
I would like the content to include some kind of jokes or puns. I also want it
to include some sort of references to popular culture.

Also interesting feature would be to use real-world, time-accurate events as inspiration for the messages.

For example, if there's an important event happening in the world at the moment,
the message could reference it somehow.
